#. Go to **Management > Node** in the top panel
#. Go to **Sensor** tab in left panel
#. Find and click **Name** or **IP** of Network Sensor

(*You will see the Nodes in the main Node view based off of the Network Sensors location*)

To Edit and Create Subfolders for Multiple Sensors
--------------------------------------------------

#. Go to **Management > Node** in the top panel
#. Go to **Sensor** tab in left panel
#. Click **Edit Tree** icon at the top right corner
#. **Right click** on your site name to assign a Network Sensor

   - In case you have many Network Sensors, you can create a subfolder by selecting Create option

#. Search for a **Network Sensor** and select it

#. Click **OK**

To Find Nodes by Node Group

   - **Categorization**
   - **Compliance**
   - **Uncategorized**

(*These are provided by default, but you can create other Node Groups by going to `Creating Node Groups`_*)

To Edit and Create Node Categories for Sensors and Node Groups
--------------------------------------------------------------

#. Go to **Group** tab in left panel
#. Click **Edit Tree** icon in the top right corner
#. **Right Click** on your site name to Create or Assign a **Sensor** or **Node Group**
