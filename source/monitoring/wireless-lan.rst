Monitoring Wireless LAN
=======================

Network Sensor with built-in Wireless Adapter scans the network and detects all Internal and Neighboring wireless SSIDs. Policy Server communicates with the installed Agent on the endpoints to leverage the built-in Wireless Adapter to collect SSID information and can detect Internal SSIDs as well as the neighboring SSIDs. You can browse and search through the WLAN view and create groups for monitoring, managing and enforcing policies. (*Without a Wireless Adapter you will not detect any WLAN SSIDs*)
