Customizing Messages
====================

Default messages can feel bland or uninformative. While they get straight to the point, a default message might not provide enough information as to why a user is blocked from the network. Other times, there may be scheduled maintenance that will cause downtime on the network, an important update that needs to be downloaded, or a new policy in place that people need to be informed about. Thus, a Custom Web Portal Message is the perfect solution

Add a Custom Web Portal Message
-------------------------------

#. Go to **Policy** in the top panel
#. Go to **Policy > Enforcement Policy** in the left Policy panel
#. Click desired **Enforcement Policy** name
#. Find **Enforcement Options > Captive Web Portal** section
#. Select desired **Redirecting to** option
#. Enter **User Message** to be displayed on **CWP** (*This message is displayed when access is denied*)
#. Click **Update**
